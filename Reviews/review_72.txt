Almost perfect for the price of 15k.Misses on the wide angle lens and the camera quality is good for normal pics. Videos and nightography is pathetic. Macro is surprisingly great! Overall average camera.Battery is above average with around 9 hrs screen time at 60 Hz and around 7.5 with 90 Hz refresh rate.Performance is the best for the price... Snapdragon 480 ~ Snapdragon 600 seriesBest display for the price. 90 Hz is very good and the colours are perfect. Loving the display!
