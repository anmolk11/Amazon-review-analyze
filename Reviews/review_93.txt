I bought it yesterday, so I'm writing honestly, this phone is osm , display is very gud , bettry life perfect , looks to mza hi aagya... But if front camera be 16 mp so it's going crazy pr overall selfie camera perform well in day. But noise is too much in night. But if u r not a selfie lover u can go for it.
