A good phone in this price range but cannot mention best and value for money. Lemme mention a few combined reviews, after using this phone for a month.1. Best phone as it doesn't get that heated up while playing high resolution games as 8nm is a good processor in this price range. There is no lagging.2. Best battery. Hardly 8% reduced after Playing "Call of duty" for 20 minutes. If used on an average basis then battery works for more than 36 hours, that's the best feature.3. Motion sensors are not that good, I noticed that while playing Asphalt 9.4. Speaker is okay, but not that loud. Speaker sounds like a normal 7 to 10k phone. Not a decent one.5. Camera is okay as there is no depth sensor which is now given in 8 to 10k phones.6. Phone is bulky. It weighs nearly 200 grams.7. Video recording is okay but not awesome.8. Gsm Arena shows this phone supports NFC but it's not.9. 90 hrtz is only for advertising when you actually use it will function the same 60 hrtz, even after you set up in settings for 90 hrtz.10. Front camera, though 8 Mp but gives a picture of 16Mp, that's the best.11. Slow motion recording is good. Looks awesome.12. Default phone call recorder informs the listener about the recording is done by you. So I'm making use of Truecaller to call and record13. You'll get an Okay speed for internet and data at the places where you are struggling to get atleast an okay speed of 4G. May be 5G band fetches to get an okay and decent speed for your 4G enabled SIM.Overall, if you have a limited tight budget and want to go for a 5G phone then considering all the above given options, you can go for this phone.In this price range, you can check Pocco X3 5G pro and Redmi 10T 5G. Everything is the same but you'll get IR remote and a bit sleek phone than this. You can compare the features and go for the best. :)Anyways, I'm happy to use this phone.
