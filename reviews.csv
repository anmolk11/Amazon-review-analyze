7,"I recently purchased a pair of walking shoes, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed! Not only did they arrive promptly, but they are also the best shoes I've found in this price range. The quality is top-notch, and the comfort level is unparalleled. They fit perfectly, and I've had no issues with blisters or discomfort. I've worn them on several walks, and my feet feel great even after extended periods of wear. I highly recommend these walking shoes to anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality option. Thank you for providing such a fantastic product!",4.0

298,Pros:1. The interior sole or base for your foot is very comfortable and soft.2. Looks stylish.3. Goes well with all casual outfits.Cons:1. The material used heats up real quick and wearing it for more than a hour becomes uncomfortable.2. Since the exterior sole is white attracts dirt quickly and the shoe Loses it‚Äôs charm.I hope you found this short review helpful will add more things as I notice them.Update[Jan ‚Äò23]: Using it as my day to day Shoe and I love it. This product has made me trust the brand Campus and will be trying their other products too.,4.0

328,"The shoe is fairly priced. But within 3 weeks of use, the back-of-the-heel to Achilles tendon padding keeps collapsing and folds in. So a shoe horn is essential to slide the heel in. The glue used to keep the in-sole in place is ineffective. So it keeps sliding out of position. All this is with the left shoe. The riht one is fine.I do not recommend this shoe. Could be a problem with the brand's quality control. So give Campus a miss since the return window is hardly 2 weeks and these problems show up with regular use.",2.0
